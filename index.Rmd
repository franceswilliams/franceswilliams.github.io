# Welcome!

I am a second year MPH student in Epidemiology at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. I have experience in research and program evaluation, and am passionate about using data to improve public health programming while advocating for social justice and health equity. I am particularly interested in reproductive health, domestic violence prevention, and criminal justice reform.

Outside of work and school, I watch lots of NPR Tiny Desk Concerts, tinker with film photography, crush crossword puzzles (through Wednesday, anyway), and occasionally play keyboard in my dad's band - [take a listen!](http://www.integralsoft.com/bboys/music/Here%20Comes%20The%20Sun.mp3)
